# Part 2:  🐻🌲 National Parks Homework! 🐻🌲

Tonight, you'll be creating a National Park website using your newfound flexbox abilities!!! 💪 This homework is a lot like the lab we did in class today. You've been given a desktop and a mobile view, and a half-empty `style.css` file with a bunch of blank declarations that you'll have to fill in with the correct number of properties.

You'll be working in `styles/style.css`. Good luck!!

_Hint: Open up `index.html` in the browser and refresh every time you make a change in the CSS._

### Here's your mockup!!
